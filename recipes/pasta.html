    <p>Pasta Primavera is a beautiful spring vegetable pasta made famous by Le Cirque, a swanky French restaurant in New York. I visited Le Cirque many years ago as a youngster and the memory of this swoon-worthy pasta has always stayed with me. This is the actual recipe from Le Cirque! You will love it.</p>
    <p>Today’s recipe is a big, wholesome vegetable fix disguised in the form of a creamy pasta. So you can pitch it to your clan as a decadent creamy pasta for dinner but know that there’s also a good hit of nutritious vegetables in it too. Life is all about balance, after all!</p>
    <p>Primavera means “spring” in Italian, and this meatless dish is all about celebrating the best green bounty the season offers up. In this spirit, don’t feel bound by the vegetables I’ve used! Use the best seasonal spring produce you find, or check out my recommendations for substitutions.</p>
