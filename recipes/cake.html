    <h1>Custard Cake With Blueberries</h1>
    <img src="../image/cake1.jpg" width="300" alt="cake">
    <p>Vanilla cake with custard baked into it, studded with bursting blueberries. Rustic. Easy. Dreamy.</p>
    <p>This cake came about as one of those “wouldn’t it be awesome if…….” ideas that suddenly materialise in my mind and I need to blurt out to anybody within earshot. I gestured enthusiastically as I described my vision of a cake and how I thought I could make it work. My excitement built as I started imagining how it was going to taste, until it bubbled over and I had to give it a go.</p>
